// Since we need to traverse all nodes of each level before moving onto the next level, we can use the Breadth First Search (BFS) technique to solve this problem.

// We can use a Queue to efficiently traverse in BFS fashion. Here are the steps of our algorithm:

// Start by pushing the root node to the queue.
// Keep iterating until the queue is empty.
// In each iteration, first count the elements in the queue (letâ€™s call it levelSize). We will have these many nodes in the current level.
// Next, remove levelSize nodes from the queue and push their value in an array to represent the current level.
// After removing each node from the queue, insert both of its children into the queue.
// If the queue is not empty, repeat from step 3 for the next level.
